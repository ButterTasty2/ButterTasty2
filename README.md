My name is Reynold Chan Feng Wan, and I am passionate about IT and Computer Science, with a particular interest in system architecture, software development, and programming. I have mastered several programming languages and tools, including C, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Oracle, and phpMyAdmin. Currently, I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can further develop my skills and contribute to projects in the IT field.

During my school projects, I worked on an Object-Oriented Programming project where I developed and integrated the OrderManager and SupplierManager systems.
